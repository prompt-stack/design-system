You’ve covered nearly all the *core web primitives* that have no parent—these are native, irreducible HTML elements that serve as the fundamental building blocks for modern web development. Every element you listed fits this criterion, with *one debatable case*:  
- **Box/Container** (“Box”, “Container”): These are common abstractions in design systems (like Chakra UI, Radix UI, or styled-system), but *do not exist as native HTML elements*. They are typically implemented as `` or ``, so the **actual primitive** is ``. For true primitiveness, reference only ``.

Otherwise, every listed element is a native HTML primitive and belongs in the definitive collection. You haven’t included a few less-common or specialist primitives (like ``, ``, ``), but these are not essential for the general-purpose UI foundations and are often omitted when focusing on typical UI skeletons.

Here is your refined summary table:

| Category        | Elements                                                                                    | Description / Role                                                                      | Parent Exists? |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Text & Content  | ``, ``, `–`, ``, ``                                              | Display plain/styled text, headings, links, images                                      | No            |
| Form Elements   | ``, ``, ``, ``, ``, ``, `` | Collect/submit user input: text, choice, toggles, dropdown, labels                      | No            |
| Layout & Structure | ``, ``, ``, ``                                                         | Group and arrange elements (generic block, lists, list items)                           | No            |
| Media           | ``, ``                                                                       | Embed or play multimedia                                                                | No            |
| Interactive     | ``, ``                                                                   | Native expand/collapse UI section                                                       | No            |

**Note:**  
- *Box/Container* should be listed as ``, its true native primitive form.

No elements in your list should be removed since all (after clarifying Box/Container) are valid web primitives. The list is representative and appropriate for a foundational “no parent” primitive table. If you seek exhaustiveness, you could add ``, ``, and ``, but your focus is consistent with modern UI essentials.
